# COMP2150  - Level Design Document

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
The level is desgined to increase difficulty as the player progresses through. The first point they get to is a checkpoint and staff pickup to get the player the ability to defend themselves from enemies. Different enemies are scattered throughout the level. The chomper is a close range enemy which will approach the player and do 1 health damage. They are easy to counter. The spitter has a ranged attack which does 1 health damage aswell. The spitter is more tricky to counter. The first challanging part of the level is when the player is faced with the first challange as there's acid at the bottom of the hill and if the player jumps too early, he will die and respawn at the checkpoint. 

### 1.1. Discovery
The player learns how to use the controls given to him with the environment and how to leverage that in order to take the most advantage. Using different platforms and areas of the map to shield from enemy attacks and spits. Players are given certain advantages to help insure that they are able to progress with ease and train up as they move through the game. Use of mellee stick to defeat close ranged enemies and then using a gun to go for long range attacks to protect themselves. Also placed through the map are health pickups to restore health. The design of my level ensures that the difficulty goes up as the player progresses. At the start, they are given easier battles and movement area which increases in difficulty as they move through allowing them to learn able the game easily.
### 1.2. Drama
The intensity of the level is gradually increased. Overall the level is not very hard and basic understanding should be enough to finish the level. The level starts off with a low intesity with no danger to the player to get used to the controls. Providing the staff pickup near a checkpoint is used to show that now the player will be facing a bit of danger. Rising up the curve a bit more which gets the player to be provoked and apply their understanding of the game so far to defeat the enemies. As we get towards the end of the level the intensity is high as the player should have 2 out of the 3 keys required to finish the level and needs to fend off more enemies than before to apply every skill that has been picked up by the player throughout the game and also having the advantage of having the gun aswell. After defeating the enemies there is a sense of relief found by the player when about to finish the game.
### 1.3. Challenge
The main challenges of the level is to defeat the enemies and obtain the key to finish the level. To control the difficulty of the level, the amount of enemies and their placement has been used in order to create a more challenging level. Such as on Key 2, there is a floating spitter which is difficult to kill as the player doesn't yet have gun to kill with. The player must dodge the spits, grab the gun then kill the spitter. Acid on key 1 is in a hole and the player has to time the jump correctly otherwise will end up in the acid and have to start again from the checkpoint. They allow the level to be challenging enough for the player to think strategicly and cross over smartly and make the right choice.
### 1.4. Exploration
The level allows for little exploration in order to figure out the best way to defeat the enemy. Much of the level is autonomus and exploration is very less but the layout introduces different aspects into the game. The pass through platform allows the player to move up in the level and prevents them from returning as to lock them in to the certain part of the level they are in. Many spots on the map where the player is just able to rest for a few seconds and recover from the fight just finished.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)

In the following photo, it is the storyboard of the level. It starts off on the left where the place starts in a box and has to work his way up on moving platforms. After that the player approaches the checkpoint and gets the the staff which unlocks the melee ability. Greeted by the first key which is protected by a chomper behind a drop of acid. It gets more difficult as the stipper is introduced and the gun pickup to kill said spitters. Move up through the Passthrough Platforms to the last part where multiple chompers and spitters are waiting to pounce and attack the player. Kill those to get the key and clean up a little bit more to get to the door to finish the level. 

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid
Found twice in the level to increase difficulty.
### 2.2. Checkpoints
1 checkpoint available before the first acid pit in case of player falling into the acid having to start over from there.
### 2.3. Chompers
Multiple chompers spread about the game to challenge the player.
### 2.4. Health Pickups
Health Pickup after the first key for the player to restore some health
### 2.5. Keys
3 keys placed strategicly around the level behind enemies to be defeated first.
### 2.6. Moving Platforms
Moving platforms at the start to get the player up and then a spitter placed to make it more difficult for the player.
### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms
Set after the second level to allow the player to climb up to level 3.
### 2.8. Spikes
Scattered around the level with the other enemies.
### 2.9. Spitters
Strategicly placed around the map with other enemies to make it difficult for the player.
### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)
Placed in the second fight of the level.
### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
Placed near the spawn for the player to get melee.

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
For iterative design, I used paper to figure out the level before implementing it in Unity as it helped me layout the structure for a low fidelity design. It helps with rapidly prototyping and not having to mess around in unity to get everything perfect. It also allows for quick modifications and altercations, making it very easy to explore different ideas and also identify any problems that could be faced while building it. Once satisfied with the paper rendition of the level, it can then be transitioned into Unity. Even in Unity, we can keep refining, evaluating and testing to see what works and what does not.It also allows to fully polish to ensure that the level will be fun for the player and that they will keep coming back to it as it engages them and motivates to continue onto the rest of the game and any subsequent sequels of the game. 

DocImages/IterativeDesgin.jpg
In my iterative design for the first bit of the level, my platform was supposed to be one long path from start to finish but I changed that to a two storey level where the player travels up through the passthrough platforms. Another thing changed is that it dipped after the start and then came back up but I changed it to going up to get the melee and then coming down.
